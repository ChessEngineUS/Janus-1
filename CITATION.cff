abstract: >
  Janus-1 is a novel processor architecture designed for real-time execution
  of large language models (LLMs) at the edge with sub-5-watt power consumption.
  The system achieves 15.8× better memory efficiency compared to existing edge
  accelerators through a co-designed approach combining INT4 quantization,
  heterogeneous SRAM+eDRAM memory hierarchy, and FSM-based stream prefetching.
  
  Key achievements include:
  - 8.2 TOPS compute performance (INT4/INT8)
  - 4.05W total power consumption
  - 256 MB on-chip KV-cache
  - 99.99% cache hit rate
  - 63 MB/W memory efficiency
  - 1.0 cycle P99 read latency
  
  The project includes a cycle-accurate simulator, power/area/thermal models,
  comprehensive test suite, and publication-ready analysis pipeline.
